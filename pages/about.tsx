        <Text>
          Graduated from MSc Interactive Media in 2015. Since then I spent a few
          years working in Munich for a Werbeagentur as a developer. During my
          time there I worked for a variety of clients in a wide range of
          fields. Since my return to Cork I have been working as a freelance
          developer and creative consultant, collaborating with artists,
          collectives, and marketing agencies. In Munich I fell in love with
          good design. It gives me joy to take inspiration from: architecture,
          print, art, music, fashion, and everyday life to create beautiful and
          accessible web products for those I work with.
